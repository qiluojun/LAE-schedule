## Project Overview

LAE (‰∏™‰∫∫Êó•Á®ã‰∏é‰∏ªÊîØÁ∫øÁÆ°ÁêÜÁ≥ªÁªü) is a personal schedule and task management system designed to help manage multiple parallel tasks with time uncertainty and anxiety. This is a blueprint project (version 1.0) focused on implementing a scheduling system with hierarchical task management.

## Architecture

This project follows a **lightweight web framework** approach running locally with browser access:

- **Backend**: Python with Flask/FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Integration**: Markdown export for Obsidian workflow

## Core Data Models

The system is built around two main SQL tables defined via SQLAlchemy:

### `activities` (Ê¥ªÂä®Â∫ì)
- Hierarchical activity/task structure with unlimited parent-child nesting
- Fields: `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `description`, `created_at`

### `scheduled_events` (Â∑≤ÂÆâÊéíÊó•Á®ã)
- Specific schedule instances linking activities to time slots
- Fields: `id`, `activity_id`, `event_date`, `time_slot`, `goal`, `notes`, `status`
- Time slot encoding: Two-digit system where first digit = period, second digit = sequence
  - Current slots: 21,22 (morning), 51,52 (afternoon), 71 (evening)
  - Extensible for future periods (e.g., 81,82 for bedtime)
- `notes` field for additional information (not included in statistics)

## Key Features & Views

### Week View (Core Interface)
- 7-day √ó 5-timeslot grid layout
- Drag-and-drop activity cards from sidebar pool
- Goal input modal for each scheduled activity
- Primary interaction interface for schedule management

### Month View 
- High-level overview of schedule density
- Navigation entry point to weekly views
- Activity count aggregation per day

### Summary View
- Activity management center (CRUD operations)
- Statistics dashboard for all activities
- Goal tracking and progress overview

## Development Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases
**Phase 1**: Backend foundation (COMPLETED)
- FastAPI project structure with SQLAlchemy models
- Complete CRUD API endpoints for activities and scheduled_events
- Calendar APIs for week/month/day views
- Statistics APIs with hierarchical data support
- Database schema with notes field added

**Phase 2**: Core UI development (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
- HTML page framework with Bootstrap + Alpine.js + SortableJS
- Summary view with activity management and tree structure
- Week view with 7√óN dynamic grid layout
- Month view basic structure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE**: Drag-and-drop functionality has technical problems in browser

### ‚úÖ Current State (UPDATED - All Issues Resolved)
- Backend APIs are fully functional and tested ‚úÖ
- Frontend interface is fully working with resolved drag-drop ‚úÖ
- Application runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000 ‚úÖ
- Core interaction flow completely functional ‚úÖ
- All critical bugs resolved ‚úÖ

### üéâ Completed Tasks (Phase 2 FINISHED)
**‚úÖ SUCCESS**: All critical functionality now working properly.

Resolved issues:
1. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Drag-and-drop functionality fully operational
2. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Activity card cloning behavior working (cards remain in pool after drag)
3. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Modal popup works correctly after successful drop
4. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Goal and notes editing workflow verified
5. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Full user interaction testing successful

### üîÑ Ready for Phase 3: Feature Enhancement
Priority items for next development session:
1. Complete month view calendar functionality  
2. Advanced statistics and reporting features
3. Enhanced user experience improvements
4. Testing drag-and-drop workflow with user validation

## Key Implementation Notes

- Use SQLAlchemy for all database operations
- Implement hierarchical queries for activity trees
- Frontend uses Bootstrap + Alpine.js + SortableJS architecture
- Drag-and-drop: Activity cards should remain in pool (clone behavior)
- Time slot encoding: 21,22,51,52,71 (extensible two-digit system)
- Backend serves both API endpoints and HTML template
- JavaScript embedded directly in HTML to avoid static file path issues

## Technical Issues & Debugging (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues (Session Summary)
1. **‚úÖ Drag-and-drop functionality**: Fixed SortableJS integration with Alpine.js context binding
2. **‚úÖ Modal popup problems**: Resolved CSS priority conflicts between Bootstrap `d-block` and Alpine.js `x-show`
3. **‚úÖ JavaScript initialization**: Fixed missing methods and proper initialization timing

### üîß Solutions Implemented
- **Bootstrap CSS Fix**: Used dynamic class binding `:class="{ 'd-block': condition }"` to prevent `!important` override
- **Context-Aware Initialization**: SortableJS only initializes in appropriate views (week view for drag-drop)
- **Robust State Management**: Added `forceCloseModal()` method for complete modal state cleanup
- **Alpine.js Integration**: Fixed `this` binding conflicts using `const self = this` pattern
- **Complete Error Handling**: Resolved all JavaScript initialization errors

### üìÅ Key Files Modified
- `app/templates/index.html` - Fixed all JavaScript integration issues
- All drag-drop logic now working correctly
- Browser Developer Console shows no errors
- Network tab confirms API calls working properly

### üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Methods Used
- Console debugging with detailed logging
- CSS inspection for Bootstrap/Alpine conflicts  
- JavaScript error tracking and resolution
- API connectivity testing

## Primary Use Case

The first core application scenario is `zeroPPD` - this should be considered when implementing features and testing the system.
