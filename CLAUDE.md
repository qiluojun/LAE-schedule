## Project Overview

LAE (‰∏™‰∫∫Êó•Á®ã‰∏é‰∏ªÊîØÁ∫øÁÆ°ÁêÜÁ≥ªÁªü) is a personal schedule and task management system designed to help manage multiple parallel tasks with time uncertainty and anxiety. This is a blueprint project (version 1.0) focused on implementing a scheduling system with hierarchical task management.

## Architecture

This project follows a **lightweight web framework** approach running locally with browser access:

- **Backend**: Python with Flask/FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Integration**: Markdown export for Obsidian workflow

## Core Data Models

The system is built around two main SQL tables defined via SQLAlchemy:

### `activities` (Ê¥ªÂä®Â∫ì)
- Hierarchical activity/task structure with unlimited parent-child nesting
- Fields: `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `description`, `created_at`

### `scheduled_events` (Â∑≤ÂÆâÊéíÊó•Á®ã)
- Specific schedule instances linking activities to time slots
- Fields: `id`, `activity_id`, `event_date`, `time_slot`, `goal`, `notes`, `status`
- Time slot encoding: Two-digit system where first digit = period, second digit = sequence
  - Current slots: 21,22 (morning), 51,52 (afternoon), 71 (evening)
  - Extensible for future periods (e.g., 81,82 for bedtime)
- `notes` field for additional information (not included in statistics)

## Key Features & Views

### Week View (Core Interface)
- 7-day √ó 5-timeslot grid layout
- Drag-and-drop activity cards from sidebar pool
- Goal input modal for each scheduled activity
- Primary interaction interface for schedule management

### Month View 
- High-level overview of schedule density
- Navigation entry point to weekly views
- Activity count aggregation per day

### Summary View
- Activity management center (CRUD operations)
- Statistics dashboard for all activities
- Goal tracking and progress overview

## Development Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases
**Phase 1**: Backend foundation (COMPLETED)
- FastAPI project structure with SQLAlchemy models
- Complete CRUD API endpoints for activities and scheduled_events
- Calendar APIs for week/month/day views
- Statistics APIs with hierarchical data support
- Database schema with notes field added

**Phase 2**: Core UI development (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

2. Mobile responsiveness improvements
3. Performance optimizations and caching
4. Additional time slot configurations
5. Data backup and recovery features

## Key Implementation Notes

- Use SQLAlchemy for all database operations
- Implement hierarchical queries for activity trees
- Frontend uses Bootstrap + Alpine.js + SortableJS architecture
- Drag-and-drop: Activity cards should remain in pool (clone behavior)
- Time slot encoding: 21,22,51,52,71 (extensible two-digit system)
- Backend serves both API endpoints and HTML template
- JavaScript embedded directly in HTML to avoid static file path issues

## Development Workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: User Testing Feedback Loop

**IMPORTANT WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT**: When implementing new features or fixes during development sessions:

1. **One Feature at a Time**: Implement only ONE feature or fix per iteration
2. **Wait for User Testing**: After completing each feature/fix, STOP and wait for user testing feedback
3. **No Automatic Continuation**: Do NOT automatically proceed to the next item in the todo list
4. **User Validation Required**: Wait for explicit user confirmation that:
   - The feature works as expected
   - No regressions were introduced
   - User is satisfied with the implementation
5. **Address Feedback First**: If issues are found, fix them before moving to the next feature
6. **Explicit Permission to Continue**: Only proceed to the next todo item when user explicitly requests it

**Why This Matters**:
- Ensures each feature is thoroughly validated before adding complexity
- Prevents cascading issues from undetected bugs
- Allows for user feedback to guide implementation details
- Maintains system stability throughout development process

**Example Workflow**:
```
‚úÖ Implement Feature A ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Tell user what to test/observe ‚Üí Wait for user feedback ‚Üí Fix issues if any
‚úÖ User confirms Feature A working ‚Üí User requests work on Feature B
‚úÖ Implement Feature B ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Tell user what to test/observe ‚Üí Wait for user feedback ‚Üí ...
```

### üìã CRITICAL: Clear Testing Instructions

**When pausing for user feedback, ALWAYS provide specific testing instructions:**

1. **Specific Actions to Test**: Tell the user exactly what operations to perform
   - Example: "Please test dragging a card from the activity pool to the Monday morning slot"
   - Example: "Try switching to the previous week and then attempt dragging"

2. **Observable Behaviors**: Specify what the user should see happen
   - Example: "The card should appear in the target slot and remain in the activity pool"
   - Example: "The week navigation should update the dates and grid content"

3. **Console Output to Monitor**: Direct attention to specific console messages
   - Example: "Watch for üéØ icons in the console showing drag target validation"
   - Example: "Check if there are any red error messages or ‚ùå symbols"

4. **UI Elements to Observe**: Point out visual changes or states
   - Example: "The target slot should highlight with a green border during dragging"
   - Example: "The modal should close automatically after saving"

5. **Error Conditions to Check**: Mention potential failure scenarios
   - Example: "If dragging fails, check if the console shows 'Invalid target' warnings"
   - Example: "Verify that no 400 API errors appear in the Network tab"

**Bad Example**:
```
"Please test the drag functionality and let me know if it works."
```

**Good Example**:
```
"Please test the following:
1. Open browser Developer Console (F12)
2. Drag a card from activity pool to Monday 21 slot
3. Watch for üéØ console message showing target validation
4. Confirm the card appears in the slot
5. Check that the card remains visible in the activity pool
6. Report any error messages (‚ùå symbols) in console"
```

## Technical Issues & Debugging (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues (Session Summary)
1. **‚úÖ Drag-and-drop functionality**: Fixed SortableJS integration with Alpine.js context binding
2. **‚úÖ Modal popup problems**: Resolved CSS priority conflicts between Bootstrap `d-block` and Alpine.js `x-show`
3. **‚úÖ JavaScript initialization**: Fixed missing methods and proper initialization timing

### üîß Solutions Implemented
- **Bootstrap CSS Fix**: Used dynamic class binding `:class="{ 'd-block': condition }"` to prevent `!important` override
- **Context-Aware Initialization**: SortableJS only initializes in appropriate views (week view for drag-drop)
- **Robust State Management**: Added `forceCloseModal()` method for complete modal state cleanup
- **Alpine.js Integration**: Fixed `this` binding conflicts using `const self = this` pattern
- **Complete Error Handling**: Resolved all JavaScript initialization errors

### üìÅ Key Files Modified
- `app/templates/index.html` - Fixed all JavaScript integration issues
- All drag-drop logic now working correctly
- Browser Developer Console shows no errors
- Network tab confirms API calls working properly

### üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Methods Used
- Console debugging with detailed logging
- CSS inspection for Bootstrap/Alpine conflicts  
- JavaScript error tracking and resolution
- API connectivity testing

## Primary Use Case

The first core application scenario is `zeroPPD` - this should be considered when implementing features and testing the system.
